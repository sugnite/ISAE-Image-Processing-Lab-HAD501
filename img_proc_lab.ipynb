The primary task is to implement a function that detects the contour of a tennis ball in each frame of a video. You'll need to analyze the provided `play_video` function and integrate your contour detection logic into this video processing workflow.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Integrate `detect_contour` into the Video Feed**: After creating the `detect_contour` function, integrate it into the `play_video` function. You'll need to determine the appropriate place in the `play_video` code to call your `detect_contour` function so that it processes each frame of the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the `play_video` Function**: Once you have integrated the `detect_contour` function, run the `play_video` function with the video file path as its argument. This should display the video feed with the detected contours of the tennis ball in each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Time your code execution : (Optionnal)** For the optional part of Exercise 4, measure the execution time of your `detect_contour` function using Python's `time` function. Start and stop the timer around the contour detection code to get the processing time for each frame. Then, use `opencv` to display this time directly on the video frames. For detailed usage of these functions, refer to the [OpenCV Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d4d/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_gui.html). This step will help you understand the efficiency of your algorithm in a real-time processing context."
